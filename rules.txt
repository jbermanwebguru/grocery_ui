if you drag on > dragover, you become dragover+1

dragging = element being dragged

dragover = element being dragged over

0 dragged over 1: 1 moves up (dragging == 0 && dragging-1 == index : up)
0 dragged over 2: 1 and 2 move up (dragging == 0 && dragging+1 < index: up)
0 dragged over 3: 1, 2 and 3 move up (dragging == 0 && dragging+1 < index : up)

1 dragged over 0: 0 moves down (dragging > 0 && dragover == 0 && dragging > index : down)
1 dragged over 2: 2 moves up (dragging > 0 && dragging < index : up)
1 dragged over 3: 3 and 2 move up (dragging > 0 && dragging < index : up)

2 dragged over 0: 0 and 1 move down (dragging > 0 && dragover == 0 && dragging < index : down)
2 dragged over 1: 1 moves down (dragging > 0 && dragging-1 == index : down)
2 dragged over 3: 2 moves up (dragging > 0 && dragging < index : up)

3 dragged over 0: 0, 1 and 2 move down (dragging > 0 && dragover == 0 && dragging < index : down)
3 dragged over 1: 1 and 2 move down (dragging > 0 && dragging > index : down)
